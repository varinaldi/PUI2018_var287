# mp4515 Plot Review


![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pathakmanu/PUI2018_mp4515/master/HW8_mp4515/plot_delivery.png)

The plot shows USPS coverage area of Sacramento County represented by the color yellow and purple for area that is not covered by USPS. The choice of colors are very aesthetic and accentuate the coverage area. It would be interesting to see what feature is there in the not covered area. A legend to the plot would also makes it easier for the readers to know which one is which without reading the caption.
