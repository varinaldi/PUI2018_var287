# Peer review for plot 
## Author: Yushi Chen(yc3763)
### Clarity: 
Your plot shows the Airbnb listing distribution in NYC.It is clear that you show the price distributions in different areas with different color It is very good that you include a clear caption to describe your plot.

+ Suggection: 
1.  it is better to include a basemap of NYC for reader to understand the spatial context for those color mapping.


### Esthetic:
The color you choose to deliver your map generaly is good; however, the colors for "0.00-50.00" and "50.00-70.00" price range are hard to differenciate on the map. It is better that if you can color than easier to differenciate. 


### Honesty:
The plot is honest and doesnt deform the data. The process of code seems logical.
