1. Hypothesis: good idea but the hypothesis is not the same clear. It will be better if you use the mean of the subcriber's trip duration  or use the proportion of subcriber in weekends as variables.
2. Add the fomular to hypothesis like: (suppose you plan to use the first hypothesis: to compare the mean of two sample)
$ H0: Subscriber‘s mean >= Customer's mean $
$ H1: Subscriber‘s mean <= Customer's mean $
> Test
I will recommend 1 tail T-test based on the hypothesis above
